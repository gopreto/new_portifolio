                    <p class="mb-4">Olá! I’m Giovanni - a Brazilian-born designer with Italian roots, now based in San Francisco. I’ve been a creative at heart since I was a kid, always drawing, building, or crafting something with my hands. That curiosity led me to study engineering, driven by a desire to understand how things work. But after graduating, I realized I wanted to do work that let me tap more into my creativity and connect with people on a human level - that’s when I found UX/UI design.</p>
    
                    <p class="mb-4">Growing up in Brazil, shaped by a blend of Latin American and Italian cultures, gave me a deep appreciation for diversity and the way cultural and socioeconomic differences influence how people experience the world. It strengthened my belief that design should be inclusive, adaptable, and grounded in empathy.</p>
    
                    <p class="mb-4">My engineering background taught me to think critically, approach problems methodically, and design with intention. Today, I combine those skills with a passion for creating digital experiences that are intuitive, useful, and beautiful.</p>
    
                    <p class="mb-4">When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me throwing pottery, getting into a DIY project, or hiking around the Bay Area. I’m also a big dog lover - I walk dogs in my neighborhood and will 100% give your pup a belly rub.</p>
    
                    <p class="mb-4">I’m always excited by opportunities to grow, collaborate, and design things that make everyday life just a little easier — and a lot more delightful.</p>
